# Hello üëã, I'm an Electrical Engineer from the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I graduated in 2023 with a specialization in Embedded Systems and IC Design. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of what I do:

## Expertise üõ†Ô∏è

- **Programming Languages**: Embedded C and Python. 
- **Hardware Descriptive**: Verilog and SystemVerilog.
- **Microcontrollers**: Proficient with various variants of ESP32, STM32, and Arduino, integrating communication protocols like SPI, I2C, USART/UART, and CAN.
- **PCB Design**: Experienced in designing customized PCBs for microcontrollers with a focus on power management and efficient sleep schedules.
- **Wireless Communication**: Skilled in LoRa communication for wireless sensor networks.

## Experience üíº
- Electrical Intern at Empower to lead program by [Fatima Fertilizers](https://fatima-group.com).
- Associate IC design engineer at [10XEngineers](https://10xengineers.ai). 
- Currently working as a Research Associate at the Centre of Water Informatics and Technology, [WIT LUMS](https://wit.lums.edu.pk/).
- My role involves both development and research focused on embedded systems.

## IC Design Projects üñ•Ô∏è

- **Single Cycle RISC-V Processor**: A basic RISC-V processor operating in a single cycle per instruction.
- **Multi-Cycle RV32 Processor**: A more complex RV32 design that operates over multiple cycles to optimize timing and resource use.
- **5-Stage Pipelined RV32 Processor**: An advanced implementation featuring a 5-stage instruction pipeline to enhance throughput.
- **SV32 Standard MMU with TLB**: A memory management unit designed according to SV32 standards, including a Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).

## Coding Philosophy üîç

- I emphasize the efficient use of timing, memory, and resources to ensure effective coding within limited resource environments.
